DreymaR's Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks
====================================
<br>

### For Linux using XKB

* Improved "Colemak[eD]" AltGr mappings (lv3-4), placing dead keys on AltGr+symbol keys
* Powerful Extend layers using Caps Lock as a lv5 modifier for navigation/editing from the home position and more!
* Comfy Angle/Wide ergo modifications to improve wrist angles(!), hand spacing and right pinky movement+load
* The Curl-DH ergo mod to allow a more natural finger curvature and avoid lateral stretches
	- The Colemak-DH layout on normal row-staggered keyboards, is a combination of the Curl-DH and Angle mods
* The Sym ergo mod to improve access to often-used symbol keys
* For several locales, a 'Unified Symbols' layout with only a few necessary changes from the standard Colemak[eD]
* Also, a layout to 'Keep Local Symbols' like their default (QWERTY-type) counterparts for that locale
* Intuitive phonetic layouts for Cyrillic, Greek and Hebrew scripts
* Mirrored Colemak that allows one-handed typing with practically no re-learning (if I ever break an arm...)
* The 4 Tarmak transitional Colemak layouts for learning Colemak(-DH) in smaller steps if so desired

Some info
---------

* First, run the install script. This copies my modified files into the system X11 directory. Original files are backed up by default.
* You can now probably use the system's layout settings to choose a setup. 
* For info on what your choices are, consult the [Big Bag][BigBag] pages.
* However, some layout settings won't let you set the model component that I use for some ergo mods.
* The setkb script activates a Big Bag layout setup (model, layout and option components) using a `setxkbmap` command.
* The setkb script can write its command to a file that gets sourced at startup, like `~/.bashrc`; check your distro for which file(s) to use.
* Run the install and setkb scripts with -h (or look inside them) for more help and info about their workings!
* Learn about `setkb.sh "model locale variant"` shortstring syntax in the [BigBag][BigBag4X].
	- The default is `"5caw us us"`: PC105(ISO) board with Curl(DH)AngleWide mods, US locale, Cmk-eD UniversalSymbols variant.
	- To switch to, say, an ANSI board without ergo mods, that's `4n` instead of `5caw`. Look in the scripts.
* NOTE: It may be necessary to select "Use system defaults" if you have changed anything in the OS GUI layout settings.
<br>

Tips
----
* Before trying out the BigBag, you may want to find out what your current XKB settings are. One way of seeing what you use is `setxkbmap -v 9`.
	- To get the standard US default layout back, you can use `setkb 4n` for ANSI keyboards; `5n` for ISO. What you want depends on your locale.
	- Generally, use `setkb 4n/5n [loc [var]]` to get back your locale layout/model. The `[var]` is for variant; omit it for the default/basic one.
* Due to complaints from new users that Extend on F# keys interferes with `Ctrl+Alt+F#` TTY shortcuts, FKey Extend is now disabled by default.
	- You can enable FKey Extend by activating the [include "extend(lv5_fk)"][BB-ExtFK] bit (delete the trailing slashes) in the `symbols/extend` file.
	- If you had already installed the BigBag you must either edit the file in its target X11 directory, or edit and then reinstall the files.
	- In theory, we could make such shortcuts part of Extend so you can have both them and the Multimedia key shortcuts. I'll think about it.
* To just get Extend with the currently active layout, use `setxkbmap -v 9 -option "" -option "misc:extend,lv5:caps_switch_lock,compose:menu"`.
	- The first `-option ""` clears any existing option settings, while the one with non-empty arguments add to existing options.
* The 'Keep Symbols' layouts are intended for those who aren't ready to give up their symbol mappings. Not the best option, but "training wheels".
	- The Unified 'us' variants are usually much better. The 'ks' ones will miss out on some symbols and many dead keys.
* The `xkb-data` package is very consistent between distros. I've use [Debian xkb-data][XKB-DebS], sometimes with some Ubuntu updates.
* Any .deb package may be opened using `dpkg -x` or `ar -xv` (from `binutils`) on Linux
	- On Windows, you can use any decent zip manager such as PeaZip.
* To change your logon keyboard layout, use the `dpkg-reconfigure` command:
	- `sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration`
	- NOTE: Be sure you know how to type your password afterwards!
<br>

localectl
---------
* You can use the `localectl set-x11-keymap` command to make changes persistent; you may have to run it with `sudo` privileges
* Syntax: `[sudo] localectl [--no-convert] set-x11-keymap layout [model [variant [options]]]`
* Example: `sudo localectl set-x11-keymap us pc105awide cmk_ed_us "lv5:caps_switch_lock,misc:extend"`
* For `layout` and `[variant]`, you can use for instance `"us,us"` and `"cmk_ed_us,"` to switch between Cmk-eD and the default us layout
* Unfortunately, you can't switch between multiple models nor options this way – so your QWERTY may have the Angle (and Curl!) mods...
* Add `--no-convert` to not convert between closest matching console and X11 keyboard mappings; this precludes applying as system console mapping
* Note that XKB options may be overridden by the settings tools used with desktop environments like GNOME and KDE
* More info on setting keyboard layouts is found in the Arch Manual and Wiki, at: 
	- https://man.archlinux.org/man/localectl.1
	- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Using_localectl
	- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Linux_console/Keyboard_configuration#Persistent_configuration
* Thanks to: Daniele, i-c-u-p, Flomza and others at the Cmk Discord for helping find this out

Wayland & Friends
-----------------
Wayland has a somewhat different tack: It uses xkb-data files, but not an X server. So the setkb script won't work there, but the BigBag as such will.

It depends on which Wayland Compositor you're using. Sorry, but I don't know them all. See its docs for more info?

For the popular Sway compositor, add a piece like this example to your `~/.config/sway/config` file:
```
input * {
  xkb_model     pc105awide
  xkb_layout    us
  xkb_variant   cmk_ed_us
  xkb_options   lv5:caps_switch_lock,misc:extend,compose:menu
}
```

And here's one for Hyprland's `~/.config/hypr/hyprland` file:
```
input {
    kb_rules=evdev
    kb_model=pc105awide
    kb_layout=us
    kb_variant=cmk_ed_dh
    kb_options=misc:extend,lv5:caps_switch_lock,compose:menu
    repeat_rate=40
    repeat_delay=200
}
``` 
The repeat settings are of course optional. Some like a higher repeat rate and a lower delay, and this is how to get that.

Here's a KDE Settings `~/.config/kxkbrc` file. It can be set via the Settings GUI, or edited directly:
```
[$Version]
update_info=kxkb_variants.upd:split-variants,kxkb.upd:remove-empty-lists,kxkb.upd:add-back-resetoptions

[Layout]
DisplayNames=,
LayoutList=us,us
LayoutLoopCount=-1
Model=pc104awide
Options=grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp:win_space_toggle,caps:backspace,lv3:ralt_switch_multikey,compose:menu
ResetOldOptions=true
ShowFlag=false
ShowLabel=true
ShowLayoutIndicator=true
ShowSingle=true
Use=true
VariantList=cmk_ed_dh,
``` 
This one uses Caps as a Backspace. See the example above to upgrade it to an Extend key.

In NixOS without Wayland/Sway, [services.xserver](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Keyboard_Layout_Customization) should work:
```
services.xserver = {
  layout = "us";
  xkbVariant = "cmk_ed_dh";
  xkbModel   = "pc105awide";
  xkbOptions = "misc:extend,lv5:caps_switch_lock,compose:menu";
};
```
To get the xserver layout in your console as well, use `console.useXkbConfig` in your `configuration.nix` file.

I guess the solution will be quite similar for other compositors, but I don't know more at the moment.

There are plenty of explanations and further links in there.

TODO/DONE for this repo are found in the [xmod folder README][xmREADME].

One good source of info on the `xkb-data` package is the [xkeyboard-config][XKB-conf] repository itself, and its `docs` folder. The repo is found at [GitLab][XKBgitLb].

Or, have a look in the X.Org Wiki.

Arch has good documentation on all things XKB.

Ivan Pascal is a grandmaster of XKB; to learn it better you should definitely consult his site. Though maybe a bit less complete for us who can't read Russian, it's well worth it.
